## Summary

### Smoking And Its Effects
Smoking is a major cause of illness and premature death in the UK.
It not only harms the smoker but also those around them.
Second-hand smoke can lead to health issues in adults and children, such as coughing and asthma symptoms.

### Smoking Cessation Support
The text discusses the importance of providing support to individuals who want to quit smoking.

## Study subjects

### 30000 people
- It has been proven to be one of the biggest killers in the UK. ==Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Approximately 30,000 people in the UK die each year from COPD==. Around nine in 10 of these deaths are linked to smoking

### 35000 people
- This disease causes people to be extremely ill for several years before they pass away. ==Lung cancer: In the UK, around 35,000 people die from lung cancer every year==. Smoking causes seven out of 10 of these deaths

## Findings
- Increased lung capacity: Within nine months of stopping smoking, you gain 10% of your lung capacity back
